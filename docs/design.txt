  Initialize audio, Eplay, Aplay, Dplay, Bplay, Gplay, HighEplay, Pause

  Define function initAudioPlayer
    Assign button "E" to "Eplay"
      onclick playPause
    Assign button "A" to "Aplay"
      onclick playPause
    Assign button "D" to "Dplay"
      onclick playPause
    Assign button "B" to "Bplay"
      onclick playPause
    Assign button "G" to "Gplay"
      onclick playPause
    Assign button "highE" to "playHighE"
      onclick playPause
    Assign button "pause" to "pause"
      onclick audio.pause
    End initAudioPlayer

  Define function playPause
    Assign audio new audio
    Switch note
      CASE OF 
        "E": play E
        "A": play A
        "D": play D
        "B": play B
        "G": play G
        "highE": play high E
        "pause": pause 
        default: pause
      ENDCASE

      IF audio.paused THEN
        audio.play
      ELSE 
        audio.pause
      ENDIF
  END playPause

  return initAudioPlayer
